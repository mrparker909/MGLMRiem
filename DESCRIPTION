Description: This package contains the algorithm from the conference paper: Kim, H. J., Adluru, N., Collins, M. D., Chung, M. K., Bendin, B. B., Johnson, S. C., … Singh, V. (2014). Multivariate General Linear Models (MGLM) on Riemannian Manifolds with Applications to Statistical Analysis of Diffusion Weighted Images. 2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2705–2712. https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2014.352. All credit for the mglm_spd algorithm goes to the paper authors, blame for errors in the code goes to Matthew RP Parker 2019 (who ported the matlab code to R, and modified it).
