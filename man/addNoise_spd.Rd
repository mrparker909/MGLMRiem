\usage{
addNoise_spd(A, SNR = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{An SPD matrix which will be noisified.}

\item{SNR}{Signal to Noise ratio to be used in generating the noise.}
}
\description{
Adds random noise to an SPD matrix, given a signal to noise ratio. Signal and Noise are measured as distance on the SPD manifold. If A is the SPD matrix, N is the noise matrix, and I is the identity matrix, then Signal=dist(I,A), Noise=dist(A,N)).
